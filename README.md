Analysis of survey data to better understand Star Wars fans

Introduction:-

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the team at FiveThirtyEight was interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. One question that particularly interested the team was: "Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?"

The team needed to collect data before they could get started answering this question. They used SurveyMonkey, an online survey tool, to survey Star Wars fans. They received 835 responses total.

The data has several columns, including:

RespondentID -- An anonymized ID of the person taking the survey.
Gender -- Gender of the respondent.
Age -- Age of the respondent.
Household Income -- Income of the respondent.
Education -- Education level of the respondent.
Location (Census Region) -- Location of the respondent.
Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? -- Yes or No response.
Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? -- Yes or No response.

This dataset, however required lots of data cleaning through which I could practice my skills.

After the analysis, we could easily visualize and answer the two main questions:
1- Which movie recieved the highest average rating?
2- Which was the most watched Star Wars movie?
